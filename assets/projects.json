        "description": "ScrapCooks is a Figma design concept for a platform that helps users create recipes from leftover ingredients, reducing food waste. I began by researching home cooks, discovering 80% struggle with leftover inspiration, which led me to design a clean, warm interface with a red and beige palette to evoke a cozy kitchen vibe. I crafted wireframes and iterated into high-fidelity mockups to build this."
